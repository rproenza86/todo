Just typing this up in case anyone needs to reference it later.

1)	Finish your branch
2)	Push your branch to server (example: git push origin feature/MMANALOGUE-110)
3)	Check out development branch (example: git checkout development)
4)	Update development branch (example: git pull)
5)	Switch back to your branch (example git checkout feature/MMANALOGUE-110)
6)	Merge in recent changes on development (git merge development)
7)	Resolve any conflicts
8)	Test application
9)	Push changes to your branch (git push origin feature/MMANALOGUE-110)
10)	Create Pull request on code cloud (using the web browser)
11)	Switch to development (example: git checkout development)
12)	Merge branch into development (example: git merge feature/MMANALOGUE-110)
13)	Step 12 should be fast forward merge unless someone pushed changes to development between steps 4 and 12â€¦. If not a fast forward merge then you need to resolve conflicts and reverse merge them back into your branch and push them to server
14)	Test app
15)	Push merged development branch to server (example: git push origin development)
16)	Create pull request to QA (use code cloud web interface)
